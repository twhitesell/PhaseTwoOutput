Guidelines for Part 2:

--> The project specifications will be anonymized and randomly assigned to different teams
--> An architecture document is created based on the specification. 
--> The document will be organized according to the "4+1 Views" format.
--> The functions to be implemented are prioritized
--> The specifications are implemented and tested according to this priority

Comparison of implementations

--> the original specification team attempts the acceptance tests on the new implementation
--> The specification team makes a brief presentation discussing how the resulting implementation matched (or did not match) with the original intentions of the specification
--> The implementation team helps prepare the presentation by reflecting on the possible reasons for the similarities and differences

Software engineering notes

--> It is expected that each team will use sound project management principles in developing the project:
-----> use a project tracking system to coordinate work among teammates (updated at least weekly)
-----> use a version control system to coordinate code contributions (regularly updated)
-----> follow a disciplined testing process while creating the implementation
